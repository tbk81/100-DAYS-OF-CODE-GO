As I'm learning go, I wanted some more exercises to practice with and have a demo of the program I'm trying to recreate. 100 days of code:
the complete python bootcamp (by Angela Yu) did a great job of teaching me python but also how to be a good programmer. This repo is not
about recreating pyhton code as go code but to recreate the project as a whole in golang. I'm using the demo as the scope of the project
and how the end product should behave (ie the python code is not even looked at!).
